## Contributors Readme

Obviously you are free to edit the code on your copy(ies) to tailor the utility for your needs and environments.  Still you are free to submit ideas to Jeremy O'Connell, the lead developer, for consideration to the main branch.  There are contact methods in the README.md file or you may view the Github project page.

**Please read this document as it explains why certain actions were taken for the code.**

### General Points

1) In no way is this code perfect.  There are areas that could be coded better.  After all coding is a journey and not a destination.  However everything has been tested to work on major Linuxes.

2) It should be noted this system is designed to work in many environments and different BASH versions.  So keep in mind while some areas of coding could be streamlined for a specific environment it would break it in others.  Thus some code was chosen not for streamlining but for broader compatibility.

**Remember code in the main branch should have mass compatibility, which again can sometimes limit streamlining**

3) This isn't a game that needs every ounce of speed.  There are no objections to having better code but mass compatibility is key.  So what would be better in some environments would break in others.

This project should attempt to work in as many environments as possible, which does limit speed at times.  Still this utility is very fast and often what is technically slower for a computer can't be detected by us humans.

4) Also keep in mind some coding is six in one and half dozen in another.  There are often multiple ways to code for a specific function so some of the code may or may not be the way you would do it.

5) It goes without saying but any code that is included into the main branch may be edited at the discretion of Jeremy O'Connell.  You may receive credit in the credit section if desired.
